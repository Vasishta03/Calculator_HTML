### I've created a modern calculator following best practices with separated concerns and modular code structure. 

The calculator is now running and ready to use. You can:

- Click the buttons to perform calculations
- Use your keyboard for input
- Clear with the 'C' button or 'Escape' key
- View your previous operation above the current input
- Handle decimal numbers
- See formatted large numbers with thousand separators
